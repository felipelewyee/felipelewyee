## A quantum chemist lost in the quantum world

I am interested in the development of natural orbital functionals to deal with the gratest challanges of quantum chemistry, as well as in quantum computng for quantum chemistry. Proudly graduated from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), I am currently a postdoc at the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC).
